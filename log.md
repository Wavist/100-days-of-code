# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 19, 2020

 **Today's Progress** Started out by reviewing ES6 functions
                      Looked into the scope of both let and var in ES6 and 
                      worked with arrow functions.
                      Got a better understanding of  spread operators (...).
**Thoughts**: I see JS everywhere


### Day 2: September 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: (: Had a look at Primitive vs Reference values in ES6 and  also got to play with the "For in and For of" loop.
                      (: Do you style CSS inline? I'd probably only do that if the style change is miniscule or I want to store and use it as a variable.
                      

**Thoughts**: I'm discovering things i missed in JS


### Day 3: September 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**:(: Created my first Component in React. 
                      (: Created Passed and used multiple props.
                          A quick question?
                      (:  What's the difference between  "One" and "Two"

**Thoughts** (:  What's the difference between  "One" and "Two". Getting a lil confused
